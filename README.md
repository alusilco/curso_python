## Usage
Each exercise folder contains a Python script (`exerciseX.py`) that includes solutions to the respective exercises. You can download or clone the repository and run these scripts locally on your machine. 

To run a script, navigate to its directory using the command line and execute:

```bash
python exerciseX.py
